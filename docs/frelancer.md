Hi,
I am myself also a developer and I need an other developer's help on the project in order to finish it quick.
The project is a nodejs web app and this web app will run on raspberry pi. So ve have limitted hardware resorces. 
Plese keep in mind this issue and I also need sugesstions on this project to make it run faster.

The baseline has been developed and the requested jobs are easy tasks. I will define mile stones or I will dived the needed jobs into small parts
I will continue with the same developer if I had a good comunication.

The fist step is form to add edit save a json file issues and list the files in a directory.

Please suggest in your request the way you make this app faster.
